				                                                       Welcome! 

This is a miniature website designed by BRAC University students as a project for one of their courses. The purpose of the project was to design how an ATM Booth functions on a small scale. For details, please refer to the description of the video: https://youtu.be/d5D5CZWDI1w	          











                                               CUSTOMER PANEL

- Customer/User logs in and is presented with a form containing 3 options: 
                                                                                a) Check current balance
							                                                                         b) Withdraw money
							                                                                         c) Show transaction details

- Upon choosing the first option, the user sees the amount of money in his/her account.

- The second option allows the user to withdraw money from his/her account.

- Finally, the transaction history of the user can be seen by choosing the third option.

- When a manager logs in, a table showing details of the users of the ATM booth is displayed on the home page.

- In the navigation bar, there are two options: a) Register Customer
				                                   b) Request(s) made by            customer(s)

- A manager can fill out the registration form for a new customer if the first option is chosen.

- When an admin logs in, he/she is presented with the 'Website Stats' on the home page.

- 'Register new administrators' allows the admin to do the same as mentioned above.

- An admin can check the customer database by clicking on the 3rd options, with the option to remove a customer if needed.
